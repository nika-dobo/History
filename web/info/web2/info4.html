                <h1>The Hidden Century</h1>
            </div>
            <p>At the beginning of the 19th century, world history was divided into two — real, familiar events almost
                did not happen. Instead of famous emperors, presidents and political leaders, in this era there were
                completely different people and a completely different balance of power.

                Europe
                The industrial revolution developed differently — its main birthplace was no longer England. Industrial
                innovations were first carried out in the small South American state of Nova Verde. From there,
                technologies and production spread. England and France, on the other hand, served only local, local
                peasants and artisans and did not become centers of imperialism.

                Napoleon Bonaparte was only a military officer here, he never reached the peak of his career, nor did he
                aspire to be an emperor. France was never a great empire — smaller, fragmented city-states took their
                place.

                North America
                The United States of America was not founded as a single state. The so-called "Cheverny Land" — a union
                of various local peoples and populations — ruled the region. There, Lincoln was never president, but a
                simple landowner, and his political influence extended only to his small territory.

                Africa and Asia
                The Industrial Revolution and global development began in Africa. The small kingdom of Kimballa became
                the world's first innovation and industrial center. From here, new technologies and science spread
                throughout the world. Africa and Asia were not colonies, but independent powerful states whose influence
                grew over Europe.

                World map and conflicts
                World wars, such as the First and Second World Wars, did not occur at all. Conflicts between states were
                almost nonexistent — there was an international alliance that peacefully resolved disagreements.

                This "hidden century" is an alternate reality where our famous historical figures did not exist or had a
                completely different role, and the world developed in a significantly different direction — more just,
                innovative, and harmonious.</p>
