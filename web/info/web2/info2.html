                <h1>Telegraph of the Dead</h1>
            </div>
            <p>In 1891, in a small French town called Mornier-sur-Lac, a young engineer and semi-occultist named
                Cl√©mence de Voir appeared. He claimed to be able to contact the dead‚Äînot through magic, but through
                technology.

                üß™ Experiment number 17: The Spectrogram
                Cl√©mence built a machine that was a combination of a telegraph and a three-way glass prism. He said that
                at death, the brain emits an electrical impulse that may be stored in the air. His device would read
                this ‚Äústored signal.‚Äù

                He first tested it in his own home‚Äîthe room of his mother, who had died years earlier. A few days later,
                the machine produced the following text:

                ‚ÄúI‚Äôm still folding your shirt under the window. Don‚Äôt forget me.‚Äù

                Cl√©mence was shocked, but continued his research.

                üïØÔ∏è Mornier-sur-Lac will become a landmark
                In 1892, a long line formed in the courtyard of his laboratory. People brought things from the dead,
                hoping that the telegraph would read their ‚Äúlast thoughts.‚Äù In some cases, the machine even made a sound
                ‚Äî and text appeared on the cloudy glass.

                For example, one woman read from her deceased child:

                ‚ÄúMother, the sun does not set there. I have borrowed your calendar.‚Äù

                ‚ö†Ô∏è Ban and disappearance
                The French Academy declared Cl√©mence a charlatan. In 1894, his laboratory burned down. He himself
                disappeared. Only the fragments of the telegraph survived ‚Äî and one note, which, as they say, he
                received from himself:

                ‚ÄúYou are also the past now. Be the voice too.‚Äù</p>
