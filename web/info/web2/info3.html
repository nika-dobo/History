                <h1>London Whirlpool Factory</h1>
            </div>
            <p>In 1873, in the industrial district of Shoreditch, London, a strange institution was opened - the "vortex
                factory", the purpose of which was to collect and process people's emotions into energy.

                The founder was a semi-famous British inventor and psychologist named Basil Ashton, who claimed that:

                "Strong emotions leave waves of sound in the human body - and I have learned to squeeze them out."

                üåÄ How did the factory work?

                People who felt:

                great joy,

                sadness,

                loss or

                missing a loved one would enter the factory.

                Inside, they were put in a booth, called "resonators", and asked questions to provoke an emotional
                reaction. Then, a large copper disk rotated around them, ‚Äúcollecting‚Äù the vortex wave.

                This energy was stored in glass domes, which glowed in different colors:

                Blue ‚Äî the loss of the past,

                Purple ‚Äî pain and overcoming pain,

                Gold ‚Äî joy and longing together.

                üåÉ Impact on the city
                In part of London, gas lamps did not turn on at night ‚Äî the factory provided enough energy. It was said
                that this light was ‚Äúfed by living feelings.‚Äù

                But people inside often talked about strange stories ‚Äî as if their memories were coming to life in the
                glass domes.

                Once a child saw how his dead brother moved in the dome, as if calling him.

                ‚ö†Ô∏è Suppression
                In 1881, the British Royal Society closed the factory ‚Äî its work was declared ‚Äúunscientific and
                psychologically dangerous.‚Äù But rumors still circulate in London that the vortex's energy has not
                disappeared‚Äîand its glowing balls are hidden in the city's underground tunnels.</p>
