                <h1>The Mechanical King of Winterland</h1>
            </div>
            <p>In 1856, in the small Swiss village of Winterland, where watchmakers passed down their knowledge from
                generation to generation, an inventor with a strange language appeared - Dietrich Heilmann. According to
                legend, he traveled to Georgia and used a special mineral from Borjomi to process mechanisms. But most
                importantly, Dietrich wanted to create a ruler who would never make a mistake.

                🛠️ The King with an Iron Heart
                In their small village palace, Heilmann created the “Iron King” - a mechanical creature that gave
                sensible orders once a day. The king moved using huge ruler disks that changed his logic, and his
                language was written on the principle of blackboard letters.

                The first command of the “Iron King” was:

                “Always start the day on the sunny side. And when it gets dark - ask the clouds.”

                📜 People followed the advice
                Life in the village was changing — people settled disputes according to the Mechanical King’s opinion.
                Some said the King had a heart, because on several occasions he helped those in need. For example, in
                1858, he ordered everyone to stop working for two weeks and rest. That year, no serious illness spread
                in the village.

                ⚠️ Ending
                But in 1862, at night, the Mechanical King fell silent. The wheels stopped. His face darkened. His last
                words were:

                “When iron is silent, the silent heart of man can be heard.”

                Since then, his body has been kept in a closed glass cabin in the center of the village. The villagers
                still fill the iron box next to it with advice and questions — in the hope that one day the “Iron King”
                will answer again.</p>
