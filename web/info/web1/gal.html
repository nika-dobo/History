            <h1>Galileo Galileo</h1>
            <p>In 1617, when the Inquisition was already interested in the ideas of Galileo Galilei, a completely
                unusual plan arose in the scientist’s mind - an expedition beyond the borders of the Earth, which was
                known only to a select few.

                Galileo, along with his closest students, discovered an ethereal map in an old library near Florence,
                engraved with strange geometric signs and inscriptions in Arabic, Latin, and a language he did not
                recognize.

                The map indicated that there was an invisible island on Earth, the entrance to which was visible only in
                the light of the moon.

                Galileo began observing the moon with a homemade device (which he called the “lunovisor”) and it was at
                this time that he noticed a strange cosmic arc that appeared in the night sky only on Saturdays and only
                after drinking red wine — so his assistants said jokingly, although Galileo took it seriously.

                Soon, a small expedition set off for the Adriatic Sea. According to legend, they strayed from real
                geographical coordinates and ended up in a place where space seemed to collapse. There, at night,
                Galileo saw a floating stone trouser in space, which was called the “moonlight” in the sky, and from
                which it seemed to hear starry voices.

                According to legend, it was in this place that Galileo discovered the curvature of time and recorded in
                writing that “time is folded at night, and in the morning it stretches like bread dough.”

                His notes from this expedition, entitled "De Luminibus Secretis" (On the Secret Lights), disappeared
                after the intervention of the Inquisition, although one of the notebooks was discovered in the twentieth
                century by an unknown archaeologist, who soon disappeared.
