                <h1>Christopher Simonetti's flying machine</h1>
            </div>
            <p>In 1684, the Italian-Georgian inventor Christopher Simonetti found a previously unknown 13th-century plan
                in the basement of one of the oldest libraries in the Mediterranean, depicting a winged machine powered
                by human movement. This discovery became his lifelong motivation.

                Christopher lived in the village of Kursha, near Akhaltsikhe, in Samtskhe, where he set up a small
                workshop. He studied wind currents, bird movements, and the internal mechanisms of ancient mechanical
                dolls day and night. His greatest achievement was the “flying goulani,” an aerial device based on a
                combination of three principles:

                Ancient Greek geometry;

                The durability of Georgian wood;

                Italian clockwork.

                He deliberately chose the shape of the goulani—round and with soft edges—because he believed that “the
                sky loves soft edges.” The plane was designed for two people and flew between the mountains in the right
                direction of the wind.

                ✨ First flight — May 17, 1684
                The entire village gathered when Christopher made his first test flight with his friend Khozre
                Panjikidze. They covered the distance to Vardzia in five minutes, after which they landed softly on the
                ground.

                This event went beyond the borders of Georgia. The Romanian visitor Count Mircea della Scarlett, who was
                in Akhaltsikhe at the time, wrote in his diaries:

                “It was a flying nightingale in the body of a man. I saw how it fluttered through the clouds, as if it
                were sailing against time.”

                However, fear and uncertainty raised suspicions about Christopher. The church issued a statement that
                Simonetti had made a deal with the devil. The workshop was burned down, and the plans for the second
                machine were lost.

                Christopher Simonetti disappeared. According to legend, he went to the East to “live in the winds of the
                sun.” One wing of his flying machine is still preserved in the Virtual Archive collection, while the
                whereabouts of the other wing are unknown.</p>
