            <p>In 1651, in the southern part of Kakheti, where the Vashlovani Nature Reserve is now, there was a
                relatively unknown but highly developed village called Kedura. We know very little about it, but
                archaeological excavations have uncovered strange iron mechanisms that seem unbelievable even by today’s
                technology.

                Legend has it that this village was ruled by Tamaz Paruel, a young engineer who discovered how to create
                mechanical birds that were powered by the sun.

                He initially built simple airplanes out of bamboo and leather, but later created all-metal eagles —
                self-flying drone-like creatures that could observe, attack, and communicate using special sound codes.

                Tamaz used the eagles against Omar Beg, who, on behalf of the Shah of Persia, was trying to establish
                control over the territory of Kakheti. An uprising broke out in Kedura, which was called the “Iron
                Summer” — eagles occupied the sky from the morning, while the population defended themselves from
                underground tunnels.

                Omar was unable to control the eagles and retreated, but the Shah considered this a betrayal and sent a
                new army to Kedura.

                Tamaz took the last step: he built the largest mechanical bird — the “Eagle of Roots,” which was 15
                meters long and its buzzing could be heard throughout Vashlovan. According to legend, the eagle covered
                the entire village and on the last day it exploded itself so that the enemy could not capture it.

                Kedura was razed to the ground. But many years later, archaeologists found an iron wing nearby with the
                inscription:

                “You cannot take our sky from us.”</p>
