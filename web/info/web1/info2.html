                <h1>Dragon Gate</h1>
            </div>
            <p>In the spring of 1632, on the eastern shore of the Black Sea, where today the ruins of the ancient
                Georgian fortress of Gonio stand, an old monk named Gerasime Akhvlediani discovered an ancient scroll.
                The scroll was not only written in Aramaic, but also seemed to move — its letters glowed like
                phosphorescence at night and intertwined, forming geometric figures, as if showing the reader the way.

                This scroll told the legend of the “Gate of the Two Dragons” — a secret gate hidden between the northern
                seas and the mountains of Asia, guarded by two ancient dragons:

                🐲 Meridah – a dragon who ruled dreams and the arc of shadow.

                🐉 Eliraz – a dragon who could open space and bend time with the rays of the sun.

                According to the scroll, this gate existed only when three planets were in perfect alignment on Earth:
                Mercury, Jupiter, and Saturn. In 1632, this rare astronomical event occurred.

                Gerasim, who had previously been an astronomer and alchemist, realized that this was his life’s purpose.
                He assembled an expedition—the Greek astronomer Jason Fidelis, the Turkish astrologer Faruk bin
                Yildirim, and a Georgian master stonemason named Beka Chikovani. Together, they decided to build a
                geometric map based on the signs on the scroll.

                After several months of traveling, the expedition arrived at a natural arch in the dense forest of the
                Caucasus, which the locals referred to as the Dragon’s Den. At night, when the sun and the moon were
                almost aligned, two giant figures descended from the clouds – both dragons. But they were not beasts –
                their eyes reflected wisdom and sadness.

                Meridah said prophetically:

                “Only those who are not afraid of oblivion will be able to pass through the gate.”

                One of the locals belittled Gerasim, telling him that it was all a fantasy. But when the gate opened,
                they found a secret space where dragons, time, space and memories existed simultaneously. Space was a
                simultaneous reflection of the past and the future.

                This gate was open for only an hour.

                After entering, only Beka Chikovani returned, with white hair and sun-burnt leaves in his hands, saying
                only one thing:

                “We do not exist as we think.”</p>
