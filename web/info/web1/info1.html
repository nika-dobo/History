            <p>In 1623, <a href="/web/info/web1/gal.html">Galileo Galilei</a> published his legendary work “Il
                Saggiatore”, in which he
                described in detail
                the surface of the moon - hills, craters and dark stripes. However, in an alternative reality,
                everything turned out differently.

                In Japan, where Westernization was still far away, there lived a young astronomer and samurai
                Takenoshi
                Kenshi. During one of the trips of the Tokugawa shogunate, he learned about the strange conversation
                of
                European scientists - it turned out that they had fixed spots in the sky. Takenoshi decided to
                observe
                the moon with his own device.

                His device consisted of a bamboo tube and skillfully cleaned crystal plates. He did not sleep at
                night,
                watching the moon for hours. When Takenoshi first saw dark spots on the moon, he was convinced that
                they
                were the “footprints of living spirits”—legendary creatures that, in ancient Japanese mythology,
                lived
                in the sky and were called “dreamsmiths.”

                His writings and drawings of the nighttime spirit warriors on the lunar surface captivated the
                entire
                capital of Edo. Takenoshi’s work, titled “The Diary of the Heavenly Forest” (天の森の日記), became so
                popular
                that the shogunate even created a new calendar—the “Cycles of the Breath of the Spirit”—that changed
                based on observations of the dark spots on the moon.

                Thus, a completely unique system of timekeeping was created, with days dedicated to a specific
                moonspot
                and the energy of dreams.

                This cultural event also had a great influence on Japanese art and architecture: temples were built
                in
                the shape of the moon, and warriors carved images of spots on their kimonos that came from
                Takenoshi's
                paintings.

                However, in Europe this story was considered nonsense, and Galileo ironically said:
                "Perhaps it is true that dreams look at us, and we look back at them."</p>
