            </div>
            <p>In the year 2378, after death, a person's mind is stored in a central planetary network - a system known as the NeuroVault. If you want your brain to be preserved and "talk" to your loved ones after death, you must sign a contract during your lifetime.Society is divided: the living live in a metareality, and the "stored souls" live in a digital world where time does not exist. But a strange phenomenon has occurred:The dead "appear" in the lives of the living — not just on screens, but in real life. They take on forms, speak, and begin to manifest their desires.The story's protagonist, Max Draley, is a lawyer whose deceased brother, Luke, suddenly begins to interact with him. Luke appears to be alive—though Max soon discovers that he is simply a hostile artificial reflection of his brother's consciousness, fused together by the NeuroVault.Max travels deep into the planet, where the main servers of the NeuroVault are stored, and reaches a forbidden place - where the algorithm that governs the "Souls" protects its existence. Max will have a choice: destroy this system and erase the "Voices of Death" forever,If the system is left free, where living and digital souls will try to coexist.</p>
