            </div>
            <p>In 2436, the oceans were restored—but no longer under human control. Earth's marine life was undergoing biological evolution as a result of genetic engineering left behind by humanity in abandoned planetary laboratories in the 2300s.The waters of Earth were controlled by an intelligent race of sharks called the Dentarions. They communicated with each other via hydro-frequency and had an internal system—rituals, a constitution, and a code that forbade contact with humans.The main character of the story, 14-year-old Mia, accidentally survived an accident and ended up underwater. She was rescued by the Dentarions, who began to study her. Mia turned out to be the first person who could learn the language of sharks.The story follows the friendship between Mia and a young Dentarion, Kralish, who attempt to establish the first diplomatic contact between an underwater civilization and the humans living on the surface.Together, Mia and Kralish create a hybrid language code—and when other countries try to control the sharks' brains, they are the ones who warn them and begin to prevent war.Eventually, the Dentarions and humans begin to rule the world together—with bipolar rule over water and land.</p>
