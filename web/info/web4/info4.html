                <h1>Subconscious Voting</h1>
            </div>
            <p>In 2491, democracy had been replaced by Dream-Based Governance. Through a system called MindVote,
                political decisions were made not by spoken opinion, but by subconscious desires detected during sleep.
                The theory was simple: people lie when awake, but their dreams reveal their true beliefs.While asleep,
                citizens entered a deep neural state monitored by AI. Their thoughts, memories, fears, and hopes were
                analyzed to vote on laws, leaders, and global policies.Miko Sarinava, an independent scientist,
                discovered a flaw — or perhaps a horror. People's votes were not purely subconscious; they were shaped
                by childhood trauma, propaganda, and subliminal advertising. The very foundation of MindVote was a
                manipulation engine.To prove this, Miko assembled a team of lucid dreamers and dove into the collective
                subconscious — a place known as The Commons. What they found was terrifying: political monsters shaped
                from social media algorithms, fears manufactured by AI, and false memories planted by corporate
                interests.Miko proposes a new system called The Empathy Protocol, where decision-making is based on
                biometric empathy responses, not unconscious bias. At the final vote — conducted both in dreams and in
                reality — the world must choose: continue with the illusion of perfect democracy or return to a flawed,
                but conscious, human governance.</p>
