            <p>In the year 2312, the planet's perception of time has changed. Most of the world spends most of its life
                in a state of waiting—a process in which the brain shuts down and active mental activity ceases. This is
                an artificially imposed sleep-like state that It was spread under the pretext of saving energy and
                efficient use of resources.People only get out of this mode for 3 hours a day. The rest of the time
                their bodies remain in a static state and their brains only function minimally.All economic systems
                around the world were rearranged to this new rhythm, and most people became so accustomed to a "sleepy
                life" that they didn't notice how the years passed in an instant.The protagonist of the story, Lucy
                Weng—a former neurobiologist—accidentally wakes up her husband from a long sleep after 45 years. The
                husband is confused and completely unable to comprehend how time has stopped for him.Lucy begins to
                investigate and discovers that "standby mode" is actually a tool of mass control - people cannot change,
                cannot fight, and cannot create anything.Luce joins other "awakened" people and begins a movement called
                TimeWake, which aims to turn back time for the citizens of the world. The story ends with the main
                algorithm of the standby mode crashing and for the first time in 90 years, people wake up at the same
                time.</p>
