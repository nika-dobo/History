                <h1>The First Republic on Mars</h1>
            </div>
            <p>In 2195, the first permanent human city on Mars, New Delos, was declared an independent republic. This
                was a major political coup: the governments of Earth technically considered the Martian colony a
                protectorate, but the Martians demanded independence.The hero of the story, Yani Eldarov, was the city's
                architect and the main initiator of the declaration of independence. His idea was: Mars should not be a
                copy of Earth — it should become a better civilization, a new beginning.However, a coalition of
                Earthlings imposed an economic blockade on Mars. Some of the inhabitants, fed up with the lack of
                resources and the precarious conditions, turned against independence. Ian found himself torn between his
                people and his ideals.Jan decided to negotiate with Earth, but not with force — but with a new idea: the
                Martians created an artificial intelligence that would offer the countries of Earth a joint project — a
                model of planetary cooperation where no one side would dominate.In 2096, Earth and Mars first agreed to
                equality. New Delos became a prototype for interplanetary government, and Yani Eldarov became the
                president of the first space republic.</p>
