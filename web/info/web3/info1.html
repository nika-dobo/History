            <p>In the year 2042, in the technologically advanced city of Singapore, all legal cases would be decided by
                artificial intelligence. A system called JudgAI would complete court proceedings in seconds, eliminating
                the need for human intervention.One day, young lawyer Lila Cheng discovers that her father, the famous
                doctor Tan Cheng, has been arrested for illegal organ trafficking. The case is quickly solved and JudgAI
                sentences him to 35 years in prison.Lila begins her investigation and discovers that the algorithm had
                no “defensive side” — it only had digital access to evidence, but empathy and circumstances were never
                taken into account.Lila also discovered that the owners of certain data companies could manipulate the
                system and incriminate certain individuals with false data.Lila exposes the systemic corruption that has
                deprived a large part of society of its truth.Eventually, her father will be released, and JudgAI will
                be re-engineered to reflect human ethics. Lila will forever remain a “human fighting the system.”</p>
