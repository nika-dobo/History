            <p>In 2139, scientists were able to partially adjust time. A device called ChronoLink was created that could
                send a person back to a specific day in their life – but only for 24 hours and only once.Time tourism
                quickly became a new trend. People would travel back in time to their wedding day, the last time they
                saw a deceased loved one, or a moment of success.Maria Solano, a 61-year-old historian, decides to
                travel back in time—not for personal reasons, but for professional reasons. She travels to an ordinary
                village in the year 2045, where the entire population has mysteriously disappeared. She tries to
                discover what really happened that day.A female investigator has only 24 hours to find the truth. Maria
                finds herself in a situation where people are behaving in a particularly “uncivilized” manner — they
                don’t speak, they don’t look each other in the eye, and they seem to be hiding some shared secret.In the
                end, it turns out that the village participated in an experiment to erase the collective memory. Maria
                is not allowed to return to the future,Because he learned the truth. He remains in the past, as a
                janitor at the village library — and from there he warns future generations with paper letters that will
                only be opened in 100 years.</p>
