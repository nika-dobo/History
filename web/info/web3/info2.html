                <h1>Underwater city</h1>
            </div>
            <p>Western Europe was partially submerged when global warming caused sea levels to rise catastrophically in
                2082. This process was followed by a new initiative—New Atlantis—to build an underwater city.The city
                was built on the sunken coastline of Portugal, made of glass and giant biomaterials that could withstand
                the pressure of the sea. Up to 50,000 people lived here, but the residents had a strict regime: oxygen –
                dosed, movement – ​​controlled, food – synthetic.The main character of the story, 17-year-old Elia
                Santos, was born here and has never seen the surface of the sea. He notices strange phenomena: lights
                going out, water levels changing, and unfamiliar sounds echoing off the glass walls at night.When he and
                his friends go on a nighttime expedition, they discover that beneath the city is an old military base
                where artificial sea creatures were created—and they are now coming to life.Elijah bravely exposes a
                secret government experiment and makes a decision: either the city will be destroyed and the sea will
                prevail, or the inhabitants will gain their freedom. Eventually, a new Atlantis will rise to the surface
                of the water and become the first amphibious civilization.</p>
