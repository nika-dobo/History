            <p>⚙️ Exhibition: “Fragment of Simonetti’s Flying Machine”
                📍 Location: Italian Hall | 1800–1900 Wing
                🧭 Object: Parts of a metal structure and handwritten plans

                ✈️ History:
                Cristofore Simonetti, a Milanese inventor, sculptor, and collector of strange ideas, invented a flying
                machine in 1837 that, he said, “would soar against the gray sky.” It was neither a powered balloon nor
                an ornithopter. Simonetti’s vision was inspired by the sketches of Leonardo da Vinci, but with much more
                futuristic and mechanical elements.

                His invention earned the name “Mid-Heaven Factory” because the machine was built on thousands of
                rotating mechanisms powered by a steam engine and a complex balance system — based on the precise
                mechanisms of clocks.

                🔧 Structure:
                The device consisted of:

                a steam boiler,

                bronze wings attached to a metal skeleton,

                a navigation chamber in which Simonetti himself sat and controlled the mechanisms with silver wheels.

                He believed that if he set the wings in motion at the “zero equilibrium point,” the Earth itself would
                throw his machine up from the sky — not down.

                🌕 First (and last) flight:
                The flight took place in 1839, near an old rocky mining town — Castello del Vento (Wind Castle).
                Hundreds of people gathered, including poets, inventors, and monks from the neighborhood.

                When Simonetti started the engine, the car didn’t take off—on the contrary, it turned the ground upside
                down. The mechanisms created such a strong vibration that even small rocks in the ground were torn
                apart, as a result of which the car “rose into the sky” because the rock on which it stood collapsed.

                For the next three days, rumors spread around the city that Simonetti’s flying machine had been carried
                away by the wind, and it is still flying somewhere in the Alps—with a flag fluttering inside its wooden
                frame and Simonetti’s smile.

                📚 The sanctity of the object:

                The museum preserves:

                Half of the left wing, still covered in bronze shine,

                A small part of the wheels of the navigation camera,

                Handwritten plans—on the page I wrote: “This is how drawing in the sky begins.”

                🗝️ Curator's Note:
                “While ancient Italy was presenting statues of the Virgin Mary, Simonetti was creating a steel saint who
                would never fall to the ground. He may not have taken flight, but the highest dream in history began
                from the ground.”
                — Vincenzo D’Arelli, an expert on fictional mechanical history</p>
