            <p>⚡ Exhibit #2: The Glass and Light Dome of the “Dead Telegraph”
                📍 Location: Victorian Fantasy Hall | Alternative Technology Section
                🗓️ Time: 1874 | Alternative England, London

                📖 Legend:
                In 1874, in the East End of London, an eccentric inventor named Vincent Ashcroft invented a device that
                he claimed could receive voice signals from the dead—not through spiritual trance, but through
                electrodynamic light synchronization.

                This invention was popularly called the “Dead Telegraph.”

                🔮 How it worked:
                The invention consisted of an oval glass dome that housed Ashcroft’s special light prism mechanism. It
                incorporated copper wires and a double-sided “lucidium crystal” — a rare mineral that, according to
                Ashcroft, was found only near royal tombs.

                📡 Every time a strong electrical impulse passed through the prism, a ghostly flicker appeared in the
                glass, which was broken into a code of light.

                Ashcroft called this code: “Lumen-Sacrebi” — the last flickering phrase of the deceased’s soul.

                👻 Famous program:
                In one of the experiments, which was also attended by journalists, the telegraph supposedly received a
                message from a high priest who had died 30 years earlier. The message consisted of just four words:

                “Invite me, light. I am cold.”

                📺 The museum features:
                The original glass dome and the lower part of the device (broken off due to the explosion at high
                altitude)

                Ashcroft's diary, which contains a record of experiments that allegedly disturbed people's sleep

                Interactive installation: the visitor can touch the glass model and experience the same flickering of
                light that was then perceived in the "spirit room"

                🧪 The opinion of scientists:
                Although modern scientists often consider Ashcroft's invention an example of a mechanical illusion, his
                dome is still observed by a group of psychics who claim that some lights still do not repeat a logical
                signal...</p>
