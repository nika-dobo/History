            <p>🏮Exhibition: “The Diary of the Celestial Forest” — Original Scroll by Takenoshi Kenshi
                📍 Location: Japan Hall | 1600–1700 Wing
                🖌️ Object: Hand-painted 4-meter scroll on bamboo paper

                📜 History:
                Takenoshi Kenshi, known as the “Night Seer,” was a Japanese astronomer, artist, and samurai who lived
                during the early Tokugawa shogunate, in the first half of the 17th century. Although Japan at that time
                was strictly isolated from Western influence, during one of his trade missions, Takenoshi overheard
                Dutch scientists talking about celestial bodies — in particular, about strange spots on the moon.

                These words ignited a fire in Takenoshi’s heart.

                His telescope was unlike any European one. He built it himself—a bamboo tube, crystal mirrors, and
                lenses coated with clear lacquer. With this device, he observed the moon for hours.
                One night, when the moon appeared behind dark clouds, Takenoshi saw spots that he believed were not
                ordinary moons.

                According to his notes, these were “footprints of living spirits,” nocturnal creatures that, according
                to ancient Japanese myths, “created dreams and weaved people’s fates.”

                🎨 The meaning of the scroll:

                Takenoshi created a huge scroll called “The Diary of the Heavenly Forest” (天の森の日記), on which he painted
                a map of the lunar surface, the shapes of mythical spirits, their names, and the time of their activity.
                He gave the spots mysterious names such as:

                “Praying Darkness,”

                “Dead Gray of Dreams,”

                “Whispering Sun in the Heart of the Moon.”

                At the end of the scroll, he wrote:

                “When the night makes a sound, the spots change color. I don’t understand their language, but my heart
                tells me — they are more alive than we are.”

                🏯 Cultural impact:
                This scroll captured the attention of the entire Edo society. Artists created frescoes on the temple
                walls based on Takenoshi’s drawings, and the shogun even changed the calendar and introduced a new
                calendar — “cycles of the breath of the soul,” where each day had its own spot and dream protector.

                🧧 Message from the museum’s fictional curator:
                “This scroll is not just an illustration — it is a window into the reality where science and mythology
                live in one. If you believe that fantasy cannot change history — we invite you to stand before this
                scroll.”

                — Arataku Seiji, fictional curator of the mythology department</p>
