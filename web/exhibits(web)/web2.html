            <p>📜 Exhibition: “Spirit Breathing Calendar” — From the Tokugawa Era
                📍 Location: Japan Hall | Alternative Science Section
                🗓️ Period: Approx. 1689 — The Edo Period of Mysterious Reforms

                🧭 History:
                The Japanese astronomer and samurai Takenoshi Kenshi, who noticed spots of “living spirits” on the
                surface of the moon and described them in his scroll (see “The Diary of the Heavenly Forest”),
                transferred his discovery to a new system of timekeeping.

                On his initiative, the shogunate created the “Spirit Breathing Calendar” — a unique system of counting
                the years that followed the cyclical change of moonspots and their associated emotional and dreamlike
                energy.

                📅 How the calendar worked:
                The month was divided into 7 cycles, each corresponding to a specific moon spot that Takenoshi drew

                Each cycle had its own meaning:

                🌘 Black-shining circle — the birthday of the dream

                🌗 Cut blue stripe — the cycle of unsolved thoughts

                🌕 Full ring — the day of the awakening of the old soul

                There were no standard weeks or days in the calendar — each day emotionally or spiritually “said” its
                own function

                🪶 Cultural significance:
                In Japan, temples during this period organized their ceremonies according to this calendar

                Weddings were held only during the “bright footprint” cycle

                War was strictly prohibited during the “dream breathing” phase so that “the peace of the soul would not
                be disturbed”

                🧾 The museum presents:
                An original wooden board with a hand-drawn Carved moonspots and their associated daily symbols

                Takenoshi's personal note, which reads:

                "There is no time, there is only the breath of the heart towards the sky."

                Interactive display where visitors translate their birth date into a calendar and receive an
                interpretation of the "state of the soul"

                🧘 Curator's note:
                "This calendar does not count time - it listens to it. It has taught us that dreams, rather than clocks,
                should plan our days."
                — Japanese Heritage Curator Hirose Tsujimoto</p>
