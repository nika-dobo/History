            <p>👘 Exhibition: “Moon Soldier Kimono”
                📍 Location: Japan Hall | Alternative 1800–1900s Exhibition
                🧵 Object: Dark blue and silver embroidered kimono with moonspot ornament

                🌙 History:
                In an alternative Meiji era Japan, at a time when the samurai class had officially lost its status, a
                secret military group existed — the “Guardians of the Celestial Spots,” who called themselves the Moon
                Soldiers.

                Each member of this mysterious squad wore a specially sewn kimono covered with an ancient mythical map —
                the exact location of the dark spots on the moon, inspired by the legacy of Takenoshi Kenshi. It was
                believed that wearing this kimono allowed the wearer to “protect the land from the shadows of the
                heavens” — at least symbolically.

                ✨ Features:
                The fabric is made of unusually light silk, dyed with a night-blue ink that phosphorescents only in the
                moonlight.

                The kimono is embroidered with a map — a dream track, showing the places where in ancient Japanese
                mythology, spirit warriors “descend and ascend” from the surface of the moon.

                Inside the collar is an embroidered mural depicting the “Dream Battle with the Winds” — a battle scene
                that does not exist in any known record, except for this kimono.

                🗡️ Mystery:
                Legend says that the kimono belonged to Senjo Shigeyama — the fourth leader of the Moon Warriors, who
                forced his warriors to fight not against the enemy, but at the points of time in order to protect
                alternative paths to the future.

                It is said that when wearing a Senjo kimono, people dream of a voice from the sky:

                “If you want to protect the earth, embrace the sky.”

                🖼️ The museum features:
                The original kimono, protected by special lighting that simulates the moon

                Next to it is a closed box with a helmet, on which is written only one hieroglyph: 夢 (dream)

                A small note from an unknown calligrapher who claimed that the kimono can move at night and its folds
                change shape by themselves when the moon changes

                🎏 Curator’s note:
                “This is not just a garment — it is a map of the sky that acts as a curtain from the inside. Whoever
                wears it becomes part of the path.”
