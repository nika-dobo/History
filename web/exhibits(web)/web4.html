            <p>🌀 Exhibition: “The Rotating Disc of Emotion” — From the London Whirlpool Factory
                📍 Location: Hall of Britain | Alternative Technologies Section (1800–1900)
                ⚙️ Object: A complex disc mechanism constructed of copper, glass, and steel

                🕰️ History:
                In 1864, in an alternative London, in the midst of the Industrial Revolution, engineer and weird science
                enthusiast Christopher Simonett created a new type of factory — the “Emotion Processing Machine,” whose
                goal was to translate people’s inexplicable feelings into mechanical language.

                The centerpiece of this factory was the “rotating disc” — a rotating device that, when touched, recorded
                a person’s psychological state and conveyed their emotions through rotating symbols and colors.

                💠 How the disc worked:
                The user placed his hand on a special glass surface

                The mechanism began to rotate — the copper spirals inside captured the body's microelectric impulses

                Based on this, the disc displayed one of the emotional colors and symbols (for example, for fear — a
                black circle, for hope — a blue sun, for resentment — a yellow tear)

                A special institution was opened in London — the “Vortex Factory,” where people went to meet their
                emotions. It was said that sometimes the disc displayed symbols that even Simonet himself could not
                explain…

                ✨ Interesting details:
                13 unique symbols have been identified on the disc, 3 of which have not been explained to this day

                One of the last entries from the factory's diary:

                “The disc today showed a red spiral in the sun — no one has ever seen anything like it. The person who
                placed his hand on it immediately burst into tears and said that he had seen his deceased brother in a
                dream.”

                Simonnet claimed that the disc could not only detect emotions, but also predict future moods — for
                example, the anticipation of war or the birth of love

                🧪 The museum features:
                The original disc, which rotates once a day, at sunset

                Visitors can lie on a virtual platform that simulates the disc’s reaction

                Simonnet’s handwritten diary is located next to it, in which she writes:

                “If a feeling has no name, let the mechanism find it.”

                🎩 Curator’s note:
                “This is not just a device, it is a mirror that does not hear words, but feels screams.”
